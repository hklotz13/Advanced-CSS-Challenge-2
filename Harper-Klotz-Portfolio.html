        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio. Here's a bit about me:</h3>
        <div class="about" id="about_me">
            <p>Believe it or not, this portfolio is one of my first experiences learning to code. My whole life I've been a creative, dedicating my time to music, theatre, and literature. I received my degree in Communications and Creative Writing from the University of Michigan in April 2022, after completing a thesis in eco-poetry. One digital media class in the communications department sparked my interest in technology, so now I am in MSU's full stack bootcamp to dive into the world of programming. Someday, I hope to be able to combine these new skills with my passion for storytelling and break into the video game industry.</p>
